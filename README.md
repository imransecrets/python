# python naming traditions

## Function Names:

Use lowercase letters and underscores to separate words (snake_case).
Use descriptive names that indicate the purpose or action of the function.
For example: calculate_area, process_data, validate_input.

## Class Names:

Use CamelCase (also known as CapWords) to capitalize the first letter of each word in the name.
Use descriptive names that indicate the purpose or nature of the class.
For example: UserService, HttpRequestHandler, DataProcessor.

## Method Names:

Follow the same conventions as function names.
Additionally, use self as the first parameter for instance methods in classes.
For example: calculate_area, process_data, validate_input.

## Variable Names:

Use lowercase letters and underscores to separate words (snake_case).
Use descriptive names that indicate the purpose or content of the variable.
For example: user_name, total_amount, is_valid.

## Constants:

Use uppercase letters and underscores to separate words (SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE).
Use meaningful names that describe the constant's purpose.
For example: MAX_ATTEMPTS, DEFAULT_TIMEOUT, PI.

## Private Variables and Functions:

Prefix the name with a single underscore to indicate it's intended to be private (e.g., _internal_method, _private_variable).
Double underscore prefixes are used for name mangling in classes (e.g., __private_variable).

## Module Names:

Use lowercase letters and underscores to separate words (snake_case).
Use short, lowercase names that are descriptive and relevant to the module's purpose.
For example: utils, data_processing, http_client.
Packages:

Similar to module names, but may contain multiple words separated by underscores.
Package names should be short, lowercase, and descriptive.
For example: requests, sqlalchemy, numpy.
